  Let’s get this out the way first: this isn’t a reactionary decision  to Kobe Bryant’s passing. <br>  I personally think it’s disrespectful to leave Kobe Bean Bryant out of  the top  five of any <br> all time  list.  Magic and Shaq crowned Kobe as the  greatest Laker ever after he retired. <br> Shouldn’t that tell you something?  We can talk about the way Kobe impacted the game <br> and the culture of basketball but that shouldn’t even be a measurement.  We see  the multitude <br> of  accomplishments like NBA MVP, 5-time champion, two-time Finals   MVP, 18-time All-Star,<br> nine All-Defensive First Team selections, the now fourth leading scorer, and so on. Even with <br> all those accomplishments people try to tear him  down with advanced statistics like usage rate <br> and efficiency. To me, that’s absolutely silly for a guy who still managed to win just as many <br> or more titles than Bird, LeBron, Wilt, Magic, and Shaq. Did you really watch Kobe Bryant—member <br> of the NBA’s 75th  anniversary team—for 20 years and say to yourself, “Well he’s not that <br> efficient so I don’t think he’s great as he’s portrayed”? Social media can be a blessing and a curse so <br> please don’t buy into the nonsense that Bryant wasn’t as great as he was. RIP Mamba. —ZO

            When you talk about best PGs in NBA history, it would be impossible to not have Magic Johnson as No. 1. <br> For this list, he lands at No. 4 overall and for good reason. Magic simply changed the game  of basketball when <br> he burst onto the NBA scene out of Michigan State in 1979. Just think about how incredible it is that in his first <br> season in the league, Magic started Game 6 of the NBA Finals at center and dropped 42 points. He played all five <br> positions in the  game and led the Lakers to their first title in nearly a decade. This was just the start for  Magic, who <br> at his size, completely changed the way the basketball world looked at guards. His numbers and accolades look <br> unreal in 2020. With five championships, three MVPs, nine-time All-NBA first team selections, and inclusion on the NBA’s <br> 75th anniversary team, Magic had one of the best careers in league history. And the best part? Magic made the game <br> fun—that’s what made Magic  so special as a player. He and Larry Bird literally saved the league in the 80s and while <br> they couldn’t have been more different stylistically there’s no argument whose influence on the game of basketball was greater. <br> The captain of the “Showtime” Lakers should firmly be included on anyone’s NBA top 5 list. —ZF

        <div class="div5">3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</div>

        <img class="img3" src="hoop imgaes/best-nba-players-ever.jpeg (2).webp" alt="">

        <div class="div6">The NBA’s all time leading scorer and inventor of the most lethal shot in Association history,<br> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar skyhook-ed his way to 38,387 career points. Maybe, just maybe LeBron <br>James surpasses him in another four or five seasons, but it’s going take a herculean effort on The <br> King’s part to supplant the greatest center ever whose longevity is practically unrivaled. You’re not <br> supposed to win NBA Finals MVP awards 14 years apart, but Abdul-Jabbar did. He earned just about <br> every individual honor a superstar can earn, most especially six MVPs (one more than Russell and Jordan) <br> and he’s still the only player in league history to win an MVP despite his team not making the playoffs. Of <br> course he made the NBA 75 squad. Splitting his time between the Bucks and Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar won three <br> MVPs with each franchise and five of his six rings in Los Angeles. A 19-time All-Star who 15 times finished <br> in the top 5 of the MVP voting, we’ll spare you from listing out all his accolades because you’d be scrolling <br> this fine piece of #content for hours. All you really need to know is that Abdul-Jabbar is the greatest center and <br> it’s not even a debate. Bill Russell might have more titles, Wilt Chamberlain might have all those untouchable <br> records, but Abdul-Jabbar was offensively skilled in ways Russell never was and retired as the league leader in nine <br> statistical categories thanks to an impressive staying power Chamberlain couldn’t match. Abdul-Jabbar wasn’t <br> physically dominant the way Wilt or Shaquille O’Neal was, but his fluidity was something special for someone <br> of his gargantuan size. All other big man bow down to The Captain. —AC</div>
